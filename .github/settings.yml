      Adds support for intelligent email scraping of e-receipts. Emails are fetched using a pre-qualified list
      of known receipt senders and parsed locally to the mobile device to protect privacy. Emails are eagerly fetched
      starting with the most recent and working progressively in reverse chronological order when time-permitted.
